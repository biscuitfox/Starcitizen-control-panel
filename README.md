this is the code that translates the input signals from various toggle switches from a adafruit adalogger 32u4 and makes the signals into keybinds/hotkeys
the switches used are 3 position 4 nkk s-3aw toggle switches, one nkk s-8aw momentary toggle switch and a daiertek "12 Volt LED Lighted Toggle Switch with Aircraft Guard Safety Flip Cover "
i made the case out of sheet metal but can be made out of anything into any shape.
i personally used a adalogger feather 32u4 but any board that is able to emulate a keyboard should work.
